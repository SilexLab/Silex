Silex
=====

The Silex Framework is a lightweight PHP framework for creation of websites and community pages. 
It aims to be a fast and modular alternative to established frameworks.

Silex is in a very early state of development and is therefore not ready for any kind of production use yet.

### Requirements
* An up-to-date webserver like nginx, lighttpd or apache <sup>[1]</sup>
* PHP __5.4__ or later <sup>[2]</sup>
	* Matching PDO driver for the database of your choice
	* Enabled cURL, fopen or wget
	* Enabled zlib
	* Writeable and enabled cache directory
* A database such as MySQL 5, PostgreSQL, MSSQL or SQLite 3 <sup>[3]</sup>
* Some love ♥ <sup>[4]</sup>

#### Notes
__<sup>[1]</sup>__ Silex is developed primarily under nginx<br>
__<sup>[2]</sup>__ PHP 5.5 would be better, maybe 5.6 too. Uh... Just use a current PHP version greater than 5.4!<br>
__<sup>[3]</sup>__ Currently only tested and working with MySQL<br>
__<sup>[4]</sup>__ We ♥ you
