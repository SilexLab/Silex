Silex
=====

The Silex Framework is a lightweight PHP framework for creation of websites and community pages. 
It aims to be a fast and modular alternative to established frameworks.

Silex is in a very early state of development and is therefore not ready for any kind of production use yet.

### Development
Silex' developers are open for criticism, collaborators or any assistive help you can give them. You may find them in IRC.
