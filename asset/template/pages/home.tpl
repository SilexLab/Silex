			<p>The Silex Framework is a lightweight PHP framework for creation of websites and community pages. It aims to be a fast and modular alternative to established frameworks.</p>
			<p>Silex is in a very early state of development and is therefore not ready for any kind of production use yet.</p>

		<h4><i class="i i-rocket i-fw"></i> We are using only the latest web techniques</h4>
		<p>We do not support old browsers or webserver environments. If we would, Silex wouldn’t be that awesome and what it is, lightweight, fast, and extensible. We would have a big maintenance to support everything. So please upgrade your web browsers and webservers.</p>
		<div class="flex row">
			<div>
				<h6><i class="i i-html5 i-fw"></i> HTML5</h6>
				<p>HTML5 is awesome, that’s why we are using it.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h6><i class="i i-css3 i-fw"></i> CSS3</h6>
				<p>The same goes for CSS3. If you love the web and good designs you will love CSS3.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h6><i class="i i-code i-fw"></i> PHP5.4</h6>
				<p>Silex is currently written in PHP 5.6 and 5.7-dev but we haven’t used any features greater than PHP5.4. Make sure you are using at least PHP5.4, but we recommend using a more recent version of PHP best the latest.</p>

		<h4><i class="i i-cogs i-fw"></i> Software we are using</h4>
		<p>Silex made use of a few nice open-source software, some of them are slightly modified to meet our needs:</p>
		<div class="flex row">
			<div>
				<h6><i class="i i-lightbulb-o i-fw"></i> Template Engine</h6>
				<p>Smarty is the template engine of our choice, we tried <span title="twig">similar software</span> but none of these kept us satisfied. Smarty is the fastest, lightweight, feature-richest, and extensible template engine we found.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h6><i class="i i-code i-fw"></i> JavaScript Framework</h6>
				<p>We are using jQuery 2.x, an awesome fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library to make writing JavaScript more comfortable.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h6><i class="i i-code i-fw"></i> SCSS</h6>
				<p>Because we are also focusing on web design and know how much pain it is to write and maintain big CSS-files we decided to use a CSS-preprocessor. Our decision was made to SCSS (SASS) and the great compiler ScssPHP by Leaf Corcoran and Anthon Pang.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h6><i class="i i-file-text-o i-fw"></i> Text parser</h6>
				<p>We are not a big fan of BB-Codes, but we still want to give an easy way to write posts without using much HTML. Markdown was the way to go, and the parser for PHP by Carsten Brandt.</p>
